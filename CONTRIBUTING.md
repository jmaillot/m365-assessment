# Contributing to M365 Assess

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project often benefits from community feedback and contributions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Galvnyz/M365-Assess/issues) to report bugs or request features
- Include the PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`), OS, and relevant module versions
- Paste error messages and steps to reproduce

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`)
3. Make your changes following the coding standards below
4. Run PSScriptAnalyzer on any modified `.ps1` files
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes

### Coding Standards

- **`[CmdletBinding()]`** and comment-based help (`.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`, `.EXAMPLE`, `.NOTES`) on every script
- **`Verb-Noun.ps1`** file naming with approved PowerShell verbs
- **PascalCase** for parameters, **camelCase** for local variables
- No aliases, no backtick line continuations, no `$global:`, no `Invoke-Expression`
- `Write-Host` for console status messages; `Write-Output` for pipeline data
- `try/catch` around API calls and service connections
- All operations must be **read-only** (`Get-*` cmdlets only) — this tool does not modify tenant configuration

### Adding a New Collector

1. Place your script in the appropriate domain folder (e.g., `Entra/`, `Security/`)
2. Follow the existing pattern: accept `-OutputPath`, return objects to the pipeline
3. Register the collector in `Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1` under the appropriate section

### Custom Branding

To use your own branding in the HTML report, replace the images in `src/M365-Assess/assets/`:

| File | Purpose | Recommended Size |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `m365-assess-logo.png` | Report cover page logo | 400 x 120 px |
| `m365-assess-logo-white.png` | Light-on-dark variant | 400 x 120 px |
| `m365-assess-logo-light.png` | README hero (light theme) | 1024 x 1024 px |
| `m365-assess-logo-dark.png` | README hero (dark theme) | 1024 x 1024 px |
| `m365-assess-bg.png` | Cover page background | 1200 x 800 px |

## Testing

Live tenant testing is the primary validation method. Run collectors against a real or test tenant and verify CSV output and HTML report accuracy.

### Static Analysis

Use `PSScriptAnalyzer` on changed files:

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\Entra\Get-MfaReport.ps1
```

### Pester Tests

CI runs Pester tests automatically on every PR. If you are modifying collectors or Common/ helpers, run Pester locally before pushing:

```powershell
Invoke-Pester ./tests/ -Output Detailed
```

Test files live under `tests/` mirroring the source structure. When adding new collectors or modifying check logic, add or update corresponding test files.

## Error Handling Convention

Security collectors use one of two `$ErrorActionPreference` strategies:

- **Stop** - Used when API failures should halt the collector entirely. Partial results could be misleading (e.g., reporting "no risky users found" when the API call actually failed).
- **Continue** (or inherited default) - Used when individual checks are independent and a single failure should not block the remaining assessments. Critical calls use explicit `try/catch` blocks.

When writing new collectors, choose `Stop` if the collector's checks depend on a shared API response that must succeed, or `Continue` if checks are independent and can fail individually.

## Releasing to PSGallery

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To publish a new version:

1. Update `ModuleVersion` in `M365-Assess.psd1`
2. Add a changelog entry under `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Merge to `main`, then tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
4. The `release.yml` workflow validates, creates a GitHub Release, and publishes to PSGallery

Pre-release tags (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta1`) create a GitHub Release but skip PSGallery publish. Use `workflow_dispatch` with dry-run mode to test packaging without publishing.

The `PSGALLERY_API_KEY` secret must be configured in the repository's `psgallery` environment by a maintainer.
