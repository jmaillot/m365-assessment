# Release process

How M365 Assess versions are bumped, gated, tagged, and shipped.

---

## Semver rules

| Bump | When | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes to public API, output schema, or required parameters | Removed cmdlet, renamed parameter, restructured `window.REPORT_DATA` |
| **MINOR** | New collectors, new checks, new framework support, new public cmdlets | Added Defender vulnerability scanning, new `-EvidencePackage` switch |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, documentation, cosmetic report changes, dependency updates | Fixed denominator math, updated bundled SKU list, README typo |

When in doubt, bump conservatively (lean toward MINOR over PATCH).

---

## Versions vs. milestones

**Milestones are named by theme, never by version number** (e.g. "Sovereign Cloud",
"Trust at Scale" — not "v2.13.0 — Sovereign Cloud"). The version number is assigned
at **release time** from what actually shipped, per the semver rules above.

Why: work rarely ships in the order milestones were planned. v2.12.0 shipped the
content of the milestone formerly named "v2.14.0 — Report Clarity & Executive
Briefing" plus part of "Trust at Scale", while the milestone formerly named
"v2.12.0 — Solution Documentation" was still open — pre-assigned numbers collide
with reality.

The mapping from tag to milestones is recorded where people actually look:

1. The CHANGELOG version intro names the milestone(s) the release completes or advances
2. The GitHub release notes inherit that intro (they're pasted from the CHANGELOG section)
3. The milestone gets closed with its description noting "Shipped in vX.Y.Z"

## The 4 version locations

Bump every one in a single PR. CI's version-consistency gate fails if they drift.

| # | File | Field | Pattern |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `src/M365-Assess/M365-Assess.psd1` (~line 6) | `ModuleVersion` | `ModuleVersion = '2.9.0'` |
| 2 | `src/M365-Assess/M365-Assess.psd1` (~line 184) | `ReleaseNotes` | `ReleaseNotes = 'v2.9.0 - ...'` |
| 3 | `README.md` (~line 19) | Version badge | `version-2.9.0-blue` |
| 4 | `CHANGELOG.md` | New version header | `## [2.9.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` |

The `.psd1` `ModuleVersion` is the **single source of truth at runtime**. The HTML report banner, footer, and console output all read it dynamically via `Import-PowerShellDataFile`.

The other three locations are documentation/discovery surfaces that need to match. CI verifies the README badge matches the manifest version on every PR (`Quality Gates -> Version consistency` and on doc-only PRs `Docs Gates -> Version consistency`).

## Step-by-step release

After all milestone PRs have merged to `main`:

### 1. Pre-flight check

```powershell
# Confirm main is green and matches origin
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only

# All milestone issues closed
gh api repos/Galvnyz/M365-Assess/milestones/<num> --jq '{open_issues, closed_issues}'

# CHANGELOG has a [Unreleased] section to promote (or you'll write one)
grep -n '^## \[Unreleased\]' CHANGELOG.md
```

### 2. Bump version (single PR)

```powershell
git checkout -b chore/release-vX.Y.Z

# Edit the 4 locations listed above:
#   src/M365-Assess/M365-Assess.psd1: ModuleVersion + ReleaseNotes
#   README.md: version badge
#   CHANGELOG.md: rename [Unreleased] -> [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD, add new [Unreleased] block above

git add -A
git commit -m "chore(release): bump to vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin chore/release-vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --title "chore(release): bump to vX.Y.Z" --label chore
```

CI must pass — version-consistency gate confirms all 4 locations match.

### 3. Merge to main

Squash-merge. The PR title becomes the commit message; the version-bump commit on main is the canonical "this is vX.Y.Z" reference.

### 4. Tag + GitHub release (after merge)

```powershell
# Create the annotated tag from the merge commit
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create the GitHub release pulling notes from CHANGELOG
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file - <<EOF
$(awk '/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/,/^## \[/' CHANGELOG.md | sed '$d')
EOF
```

Or manually paste the CHANGELOG section into `gh release create`'s editor.

### 5. Close the milestone

```powershell
gh api -X PATCH repos/Galvnyz/M365-Assess/milestones/<num> -f state=closed
```

### 6. Regenerate doc-as-code artifacts (when source changed)

If the release added or removed Graph permissions / collectors / scope mappings:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./scripts/Build-PermissionsMatrix.ps1
git add docs/PERMISSIONS.md
git commit -m "docs: regenerate PERMISSIONS.md for vX.Y.Z"
```

If npm dependencies changed (rare):

```powershell
npm install
# Regenerate THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md per docs/REPORT-FRONTEND.md (post-C4)
```

These are separate small PRs that follow the version-bump merge.

### 7. PSGallery publish (separate workflow)

Publishing to PSGallery is currently manual; the maintainer pushes via `Publish-Module` after tag creation. Future improvement: GH Actions workflow on tag push.

---

## Release candidates (#722)

For changes you want to soak before tagging stable:

```bash
# Cut an RC branch from main
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b release-candidate
git push -u origin release-candidate
```

Pushing to `release-candidate` triggers `.github/workflows/release-candidate.yml`, which:

1. Reads the manifest version (e.g. `2.9.0`)
2. Counts existing `v2.9.0-rc.*` tags
3. Creates the next RC tag (e.g. `v2.9.0-rc.1`)
4. Pushes the tag

Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

- Marks the GitHub release as `prerelease: true` (because the tag contains `-`)
- **Skips PSGallery publish** (release.yml gates `!contains(github.ref, '-')`)

So RCs land as **GitHub-only pre-releases**, safely visible to early testers without touching PSGallery.

### Iterating on an RC

Subsequent pushes to `release-candidate` produce `v2.9.0-rc.2`, `rc.3`, etc. The workflow auto-increments by listing existing tags, so you don't have to track the counter.

### Promoting an RC to stable

Once an RC has soaked enough:

1. Open a PR from `release-candidate` -> `main`
2. Merge as usual
3. Follow the standard release flow above (version bump if needed, tag, GH release, PSGallery publish)

The stable tag (`v2.9.0`) and the RC tags (`v2.9.0-rc.1`, etc.) coexist; they all show in `git tag --list`.

### Dry-run

Use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger with `dry_run: true` to compute what RC number would be assigned without actually creating the tag. Useful when you're unsure whether a previous run already produced an RC.

---

## Branch protection

`main` requires:

- The `CI` job to pass (aggregates Quality Gates + Pester matrix + CodeQL)
- At least one PR (no direct pushes)

Doc-only PRs route to a lighter `Docs Gates` job (~30 seconds) instead of the full Pester matrix (~4 minutes), so quick text fixes don't block the maintainer queue.

---

## Hotfix procedure

For urgent post-release fixes (e.g., a regression discovered after vX.Y.Z is tagged):

1. Branch from the tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/X.Y.Z+1 vX.Y.Z`
2. Make the minimal fix; commit; push
3. Open a PR targeting `main`. Same CI gates apply.
4. Once merged, bump to `X.Y.Z+1` (PATCH) and follow steps 4-6 above.

Hotfixes never skip the version-consistency gate — every release tag has a matching CHANGELOG entry and badge update.

---

## Pre-release / RC channel (planned, #722)

`#722` tracks adding a release-candidate workflow:

- New `release-candidate` branch with branch protection
- Automatic GH pre-release tag (`vX.Y.Z-rc.1`) on push
- Soak window before promoting to a full tag

Out of scope for v2.9.0 closure but tracked for v2.10.0 or v3.0.0.

---

## When to regenerate generated docs

Generated docs are part of the source code surface. Bump the regenerator output anytime the source map changes. CI catches drift on every PR.

| Generated doc | Regen command | Source-of-truth |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` | `pwsh -File ./scripts/Build-PermissionsMatrix.ps1` | `Orchestrator/AssessmentMaps.ps1` + `Setup/PermissionDefinitions.ps1` |
| `docs/SOVEREIGN-CLOUDS.md` (post-C2) | (TBD) | `controls/sovereign-cloud-support.json` |
| `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` (post-C4) | `npm run licenses` (or equivalent) | `node_modules/` license-checker output |

CI's `-Check` mode for each generator fails the PR if the doc is out of sync. Action is always: run the generator locally, commit the updated doc, push.
